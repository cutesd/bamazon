## Overview
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.

## Demonstrates
* NodeJS
* MySQL
* NPM
* Git

## Challenge #1
* Created a MySQL Database called bamazon.
* Database is populated with around 10 different products. 
* Application first displays all of the items available for sale. 
* User is then prompted with two messages.
  * The first asks which product they would like to buy from customized list
  * second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.
* Once the customer has placed the order, your application checks if store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
  * If not, the app logs 'Insufficient quantity!', and then prevents the order from going through.
  * If store has enough of the product, app fulfills the customer's order.
* Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.


## Challenge #2
* App lists a set of menu options:
  * View Products for Sale
  * View Low Inventory
  * Add to Inventory
  * Add New Product
* If a manager selects View Products for Sale, app lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
* If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.
* If a manager selects Add to Inventory, app displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
* If a manager selects Add New Product, it allows the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
